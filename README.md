# Hospital-Management-System
Develop a database management system to manage a hospital. Assign unique IDs to the patients and store the relevant information under the same. You’ll have to add the patient’s name, personal details, contact number, disease name, and the treatment the patient is going through. You’ll also have to mention under which hospital/department the patient is (such as cardiac, gastro, etc.).
After that, you should add information about the hospital’s doctors. A doctor can treat multiple patients, and he/she would have a unique ID as well. Doctors would also be classified in different departments.
